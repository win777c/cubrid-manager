/**
 * 
 * <P>
 * An exception that provides information on a database access error or other
 * errors.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Each <code>SQLException</code> provides several kinds of information:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>a string describing the error. This is used as the Java Exception
 * message, available via the method <code>getMesage</code>.
 * <LI>a "SQLstate" string, which follows either the XOPEN SQLstate conventions
 * or the SQL 99 conventions. The values of the SQLState string are described in
 * the appropriate spec. The <code>DatabaseMetaData</code> method
 * <code>getSQLStateType</code> can be used to discover whether the driver
 * returns the XOPEN type or the SQL 99 type.
 * <LI>an integer error code that is specific to each vendor. Normally this will
 * be the actual error code returned by the underlying database.
 * <LI>a chain to a next Exception. This can be used to provide additional error
 * information.
 * </UL>
